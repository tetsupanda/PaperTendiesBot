# PaperTendiesBot
 Intial start to a C#/.NetCore trading bot, specifically using the Alpaca API. Right now this is using an example algorithm. Intentions are to continue to grow it out with some handspun trading approaches.
 
 ## Alpaca API
 - Create a free, paper trading account over at `https://alpaca.markets/`; Generate a new API Key
 - To run, you will need to put your Alpaca API Key and secret into the `appsettings.json` file.

## TODO List
 - Dockerize Service locally
 - Create Azure deployment; Includes storing/pulling secrets in azure
 - Generate personal trading algo
 - Explore ML approaches to gauge Market Sentiment
 - Print Tendies
